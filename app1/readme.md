##Testing

This is a project to illustrate the way we can use mockrunner to mock the data.  
We use this typically when we are unit testing the data access layer.  When we unit test we want to unit test 
all the methods in the class.

So where do we start?  Well we first need to create a project and then prepare the project for unit testing.
